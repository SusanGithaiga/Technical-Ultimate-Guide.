## Welcome to Technical Writing 101! 


Technical writing is like learning a new language. It takes time and effort to master, but it can be a rewarding experience. It's like trying to build a house with instructions written in a foreign language.  You might be able to figure out what to do, but it’s going to take a lot of trial and error.

As a newbie developer, I often find new concepts and terminologies hard to understand, not forgetting the nasty bugs that one encounters. But hey, it’s not all as dull and gloomy as one may think, there are our ‘heroes’ who provide a solution or an ‘escape’ from all the struggles, ‘Technical writers’.They convey all that complex information clearly and concisely so that you as the bug programmer can understand the topic you’re working on.
They present the ‘hard stuff’ in a way that is easily understandable and usable that you as the reader can easily grasp. Isn’t it nice though, the feeling that you get when you finally navigate your way through the ‘tough concepts’? The relief, excitement, and oh, the pride. It is a feeling that motivates you to keep on learning and growing, I mean, what could possibly go wrong after you’ve solved that one-week-old bug… 
And if things do go wrong, it’s a learning experience. Learning from your mistakes is important, but creating thorough documentation of those mistakes is priceless. By sharing your miss steps and thought process, you can save others from the same troubles.  You don’t need to be an expert on the web, you just need to be able to write well enough. 
Remember, it’s not about being a writing Guru, it’s about not making the internet cry with your grammar atrocities. Keep it simple, keep it witty, and watch the digital world applaud your writing prowess. That being said, this is my guide to being an awesome technical writer:



### 1. Create a purpose for your audience
 You as the writer need to clearly define the purpose of your documentation. Think of ways a reader could come to your project without having the same skill set as you and review your text to their perspective. That makes it easier for your target audience to understand the message that you are trying to relay.

### 2. Keep it simple and clear
Break down complex ideas into understandable chunks. By doing so, you make the information more accessible and avoid overwhelming your audience. By organizing your thoughts in a coherent manner, you guide your readers through your content smoothly.

### 3. Organize your work
Plan the document’s structure before writing, including headings and subheadings to assist you in exploring the project. This will save you a huge amount of time and effort if you are aware of the objectives and limitations of your technical documentation.
To ensure that you cover all the bases for your project, include the following:
- Write and finish the first version of your article.
- Read through your article and look for ways to improve your content.
- Use a Grammar and Spell checking tool of your choice and check your work for any improvements it may need. You can use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/), [Quillbot](https://quillbot.com/), Microsoft word or [Hemmingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/), just to name a few.
- Go through your work again and check for better ways of simplifying your explanations.

### 4. Visual communication.
Visuals such as diagrams, charts, graphs ,and illustrations can provide a visual representation of complex ideas, making them easier to grasp the information more effectively. Visual elements can benefit individuals with different learning styles, including visual learners who understand information better through images and graphics. 
These examples allow you to connect with your readers on a personal level. By using real-world scenarios to explain a concept, you can create mental hooks to anchor concepts into the reader’s mind, making the information more memorable.

### 5. Format your documentation
In this stage, look out for your sentence structure, grammatical errors and general mistakes. Paying attention to these elements will help to enhance the understanding and credibility of your documentation.
